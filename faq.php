            I don't see myself on the leaderboard. Is there some way I could get myself added?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Currently, there is no way on the website to add yourself to the leaderboard, but that is being worked on. If you would like to be added manually, hit me up on Discord (SDCore#0001) or Twitter (@SDCore_) with your Apex username and the platform that you play on, and I'll add you.

        <div class="question">
            Why does the leaderboard not show any rank under Platinum?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Most of the playerbase is going to be Plat+, so I don't see too much value in showing anything below that rank. There are people added to the database that are Gold or below, they just don't show up. This might be changed in the future, but for now, it's mainly a leaderboard for people looking to grind ranked and see where they place against other similar players.

        <div class="question">
            Why do certain people show as unranked in earlier rank periods, while others have their rank on their profile?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            I (currently) manually add each person to the database, so in earlier ranked seasons, there were less people than there are in later/current rank seasons. So the fact that they show as "Unranked" could be because they weren't in the database at that time, or they simply didn't play ranked for that season.
